    A Grocery Shopping List.
    Project Name: grocery-shopping-list
    Project Description: This is a shopping list website that will be used by a variety of users on a daily basis. It gives the user a catalogue, of which the use
    is able to select an item, add it to their "wish list", having being able to access this website out of any device, the user will be able to go to the specific
    shops (Which whose names will be on the product description) and buy that item. The user is able to remove items from their wish list, add a number of items and
    calculate the total price for all. With that being said, the price of each item will br attached to that item. A history log of previously added items will be
    kept in place. The user in that way is able to check on what items they have added and actually bought from the site. What is more amazing is that users are
    able to share their wish lists with any other user who has access to this site. The user on the receiving end is able to make adjustments to this wish list that
    will only be reflected on their end, thus sharing a list means giving the receiver of control over items on it.
    
    We decided to go with react-redux for the front end development of this project. Using MongoDB for the backend. Reasons for choosing to go with react-redux is
    because redux is considered to be react's official redux UI bindings. So the redux team is responsible for maintainance of the react framework directly. Being
    Reactâ€™s official Redux binding, React-Redux is updated with any modifications in API from both libraries to make sure that the React components behave
    expectedly. Me and my team face some challenges connecting the front and the back-end. This was mainly because of difference in operating systems and the
    hardships of understanding how to connect the two ends. In future, we are hoping to make the website even more user friendly and add some features related to AI
    which will recommend products based on other sites you visit.  
    
    How to use the project: This is an easy to run project, you only need to click on the website's url, create an account with us, then log in and let the wishing
    begin!
